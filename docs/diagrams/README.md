# Diagrams

- `01-ue-extension-architecture.md`: High-level components and network calls.
- `02-runtime-flow-sequence.md`: Event-driven runtime flow.
- `03-apply-decision-logic.md`: When the renderer decides to apply defaults (and why retries exist).

> These diagrams use Mermaid. In IDE like VS Code or Cursor an extension may be required to preview the MD with Mermaid diagrams; on GitHub, Mermaid renders automatically.
